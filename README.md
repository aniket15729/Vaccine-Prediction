In this project, we will analyze data from the 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey to identify factors influencing vaccination patterns during the H1N1 pandemic. Using predictive modeling techniques, we aim to uncover relationships between demographic, social, economic, and behavioral characteristics and the likelihood of vaccination. By doing so, we hope to provide actionable insights that can guide public health strategies for improving vaccine uptake during future pandemics.
